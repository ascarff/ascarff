### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist interested in looking at new roles in the field. I've recently completed the S2DS program working on reinforcement learning to mRNA design.

I'm currently learning many different machine learning techniques using O'Reilly's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow".
